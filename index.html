            <h2 class="description">The History of Hatim's Kitchen</h2>
            <p>Cooking has always been a central part of culture and tradition, bringing people together through flavours and stories.<br><br>
            For me, Spanish food holds a special place in my heart. Having lived in Spain my whole life before moving to the UK, I found myself missing the rich, comforting tastes of home.<br><br>
            To keep that connection alive, I started recreating my favourite Spanish dishes in my own kitchen.<br><br>
            Hatim's Kitchen is a celebration of those flavours, a way to bring a taste of Spain to my home in the UK.</p>

                <h2>Paella</h2>
                <p>Paella is a traditional Spanish dish that originated in the region of Valencia. It dates back to the mid-19th century and was originally a humble meal made by farm workers, using local ingredients such as rice, saffron, and vegetables. Over time, it evolved into the famous dish we know today, with variations including seafood, chicken, and rabbit. The name "paella" comes from the wide, shallow pan used to cook it, which is also called a "paella".</p>

                <h2>Fideuà</h2>
                <p>Fideuà is a dish from the Valencia region, similar to paella, but instead of 
                    rice, it uses short pasta called "fideos". The dish was created in the 1920s 
                    when a local fisherman, tired of the traditional paella, decided to use noodles
                     as a base instead of rice. The first fideuà was made with seafood, and it 
                     quickly became a beloved dish along the Mediterranean coast. Today, 
                     it is prepared in many variations, often including squid, shellfish,
                    and other seafood ingredients.</p>

                <h2>Tortilla de Patatas</h2>
                <p>The Tortilla de Patatas, or Spanish omelette, is a classic Spanish dish that 
                    originated in the early 19th century. There are many stories about its origin, 
                    but one popular theory is that it was created during the Spanish War of 
                    Independence as a simple and affordable meal to feed soldiers. The dish consists
                    of potatoes, eggs, and onions (optional), all cooked together to form a thick, 
                     earty omelette. Today, it is enjoyed throughout Spain, often served as tapas
                    or a main meal.</p>
